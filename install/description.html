<h2>Squeezer</h2>
<p>
	'Squeezer' is an extension that compiles your JavaScript code into better JavaScript with 'Google's Closure Compiler' or that compresses your JavaScript and CSS files with Yahoo's 'YUI Compressor'.
</p>
<p>
	Not only will your files be smaller and therefor download faster, in case of Google's 'Closure Compiler' it will also run faster!
</p>
<p>
	Just right-click a JavaScript or CSS file in the navigation panel of your ColdFusion Builder and you'll see the 'Squeezer'-menu coming up... select the compiler/compressor to use, fill in some settings and Squeeze!
